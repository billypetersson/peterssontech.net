## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (React)
- **State Management** - Redux Toolkit for complex state management
- **Routing** - React Router with protected routes and lazy loading
- **UI Components** - Custom component library with consistent design system
- **Form Handling** - React Hook Form with validation and error handling
- **Data Fetching** - React Query for efficient API calls and caching

### Backend (Node.js)
- **Framework** - Express.js with TypeScript for type safety
- **Database** - PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Authentication** - JWT tokens with refresh token rotation
- **File Upload** - Multer with AWS S3 integration for product images
- **Email Service** - SendGrid for transactional emails and notifications

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting** - AWS ECS with auto-scaling and load balancing
- **Database** - Amazon RDS PostgreSQL with read replicas
- **Caching** - Redis for session storage and frequently accessed data
- **CDN** - CloudFront for static asset delivery and global performance
- **Monitoring** - CloudWatch for logging and performance metrics

## Development Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Real-time Inventory Management
**Problem:** Ensuring accurate inventory levels across multiple concurrent users
**Solution:** Implemented optimistic locking with PostgreSQL and WebSocket notifications for real-time updates

### Challenge 2: Payment Security
**Problem:** Handling sensitive payment information securely
**Solution:** Integrated Stripe with PCI compliance, using tokenization and webhook validation

### Challenge 3: Performance Optimization
**Problem:** Slow page loads with large product catalogs
**Solution:** Implemented database indexing, query optimization, and Redis caching for frequently accessed data

### Challenge 4: Mobile Responsiveness
**Problem:** Complex checkout process on mobile devices
**Solution:** Designed mobile-first UI with progressive enhancement and optimized touch interactions

## Key Metrics & Results

- **Performance** - 95+ Lighthouse score across all categories
- **Security** - A+ rating on SSL Labs security test
- **Scalability** - Handles 1000+ concurrent users with <200ms response times
- **User Experience** - 4.8/5 average user satisfaction rating
- **Code Quality** - 95% test coverage with automated testing pipeline

## Code Examples

### Product API with Caching
```javascript
// products.controller.js
const getProducts = async (req, res) => {
  const cacheKey = `products:${JSON.stringify(req.query)}`;
  
  // Check cache first
  const cachedProducts = await redis.get(cacheKey);
  if (cachedProducts) {
    return res.json(JSON.parse(cachedProducts));
  }
  
  // Fetch from database
  const products = await prisma.product.findMany({
    where: buildProductFilters(req.query),
    include: { category: true, reviews: true },
    orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' }
  });
  
  // Cache for 5 minutes
  await redis.setex(cacheKey, 300, JSON.stringify(products));
  
  res.json(products);
};
```

### Real-time Inventory Updates
```javascript
// inventory.service.js
const updateInventory = async (productId, quantity) => {
  const product = await prisma.product.update({
    where: { id: productId },
    data: { inventory: { decrement: quantity } }
  });
  
  // Notify all connected clients
  io.emit('inventory-update', {
    productId,
    newQuantity: product.inventory
  });
  
  return product;
};
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Jest** for business logic and utility functions
- **React Testing Library** for component testing
- **Supertest** for API endpoint testing

### Integration Testing
- **Database Testing** with test database setup and teardown
- **API Testing** with complete request/response cycle validation
- **Payment Testing** using Stripe test mode

### End-to-End Testing
- **Cypress** for complete user journey testing
- **Cross-browser Testing** across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- **Mobile Testing** on various device sizes and orientations

## Deployment & DevOps

### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to Production
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test -- --coverage
        
  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to ECS
        run: |
          aws ecs update-service \
            --cluster production \
            --service ecommerce-api \
            --force-new-deployment
```

### Infrastructure as Code
- **Terraform** for AWS resource provisioning
- **Docker** containers for consistent deployment environments
- **Environment Variables** for configuration management

## Lessons Learned

1. **Performance Monitoring** - Early implementation of monitoring tools is crucial for identifying bottlenecks
2. **Security First** - Building security considerations into the architecture from the start saves significant refactoring later
3. **User Feedback** - Regular user testing revealed usability issues that weren't apparent during development
4. **Scalability Planning** - Designing for scale from the beginning makes growth much easier to manage

## Future Enhancements

- **Machine Learning** - Product recommendations based on user behavior
- **Multi-vendor Support** - Marketplace functionality for multiple sellers
- **Advanced Analytics** - AI-powered insights and forecasting
- **Mobile App** - Native mobile applications for iOS and Android
- **International Support** - Multi-currency and multi-language capabilities
